# Implementation Plan

## 1. Environment Setup
- Install Python 3.11 (Windows 10/11, 64-bit)
- Create virtual environment
- Install all dependencies: `groq`, `pyannote.audio`, `soundfile`, `librosa`, etc.
- Set up Groq API key and Hugging Face token

## 2. Audio Preprocessing
- Normalize audio to mono, 16kHz (if necessary)
- Validate file format/length

## 3. Speaker Diarization
- Use `pyannote.audio` to segment the audio file by speaker
- Generate a list of (speaker label, start time, end time) segments

## 4. Speech Transcription
- For each diarized segment:
    - Slice the audio file to extract segment audio
    - Send segment to Groq Whisper API for transcription
    - Retrieve text and word-level timestamps

## 5. Result Aggregation
- Combine all transcripts by time/speaker
- Build structured data: speaker label, start, end, transcript

## 6. Output and Export
- Format into CSV, JSON, and readable text transcript with speaker turns
- Optional: SRT/VTT subtitle track

## 7. Error Handling & Logging
- Implement status/error logs for API calls, audio slicing, diarization

## 8. Security
- Never store API keys in code or public repos
- Document token setup for users

## 9. Testing and Validation
- Use test audio files to validate system accuracy
- Measure word error rate (WER) and diarization accuracy; adjust pipeline as needed

## 10. Future Enhancements
- Real-time audio streaming support
- Known-speaker enrollment and identification
- UI/dashboard for uploads and result browsing
